# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.

In order to call the function later in your code, you must give it a name,
so these are known as named functions. Below, a function called area() is declared,
which can then be called using its name. 

### ex:
function area(width, height) return width * height; }; 
var size= area(3, 4) ;
