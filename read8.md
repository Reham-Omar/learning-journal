# JavaScript Loops
# summary 
- use loobs if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

## Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.

### Operator 

* == | equal to  
* === | equal value and equal type  
* != | not equal
* !== |	not equal value or not equal type
* > |	greater than
* <	| less than
* >= | greater than or equal to
* <= | less than or equal to


## Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

## The For Loop
### syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
## The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

### Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
